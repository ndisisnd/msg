# review — Security mode

**When it runs:** fourth in pipeline order — after Functional, before Performance.

**What it checks:** dedicated secret scanning (Stage 0, via gitleaks/trufflehog when detected) plus injection vulnerabilities, authentication and authorization gaps, insufficient input validation, and any remaining hardcoded credentials or API keys (semantic stage, via `/cook` flags).

## Flags

Global (always): `--security`, `--auth`

Domain flags: for each active domain from `active_domains[]` touched by the diff, prefer the security-scoped sub-ref over the broad domain flag. Security mode is the one place a focused sub-ref is almost always correct — the broad shelf adds non-security noise.

| Active domain | Preferred flag | Fallback if not security-relevant |
|---|---|---|
| React | `--react:security` | — |
| Next.js | `--nextjs:security` | — |
| TypeScript | `--typescript:security` | — |
| GraphQL | `--graphql:security` | — |
| Flutter | `--flutter:security` | — |
| Supabase | `--supabase:rls` + `--supabase:keys-and-clients` | `--supabase` |
| Database | `--database:sql-gotchas` | `--database` |
| Node.js | `--nodejs` | — (no `:security` sub-ref) |
| Dart | `--dart` | — (no `:security` sub-ref) |

For Supabase diffs, include both `--supabase:rls` and `--supabase:keys-and-clients` when the diff touches policies/clients respectively; otherwise pick the one that matches. Authoritative flag list: `refs/FLAG-LIST.md`.

## Stage 0 — Secret scan

Runs **before** the `/cook` semantic stage. Operates on `secret_scanner` from Step 2 of `SKILL.md` and the `--full-secret-scan` flag from `SKILL.md` Usage.

| `secret_scanner` value | `--full-secret-scan` | Action |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| `null` | any | Emit a single `warn` finding: `"No secret scanner detected — install gitleaks for full coverage."` Then proceed to semantic stage. |
| set | absent (default) | Run `secret_scanner.command_diff` (`<files>` substituted with the diff file list). Parse hits. |
| set | present | Run `secret_scanner.command_full` (no `<files>` substitution). Parse hits. |

Each scanner hit produces one finding:
- `severity: "block"`
- `source: "secrets:<scanner>"` (e.g. `"secrets:gitleaks"`)
- `file` and `line` populated from scanner output
- `category: "security"`
- `message`/`suggestion`: describe the leaked secret kind and recommend rotation + removal from history.

**No short-circuit:** Stage 0 **always** proceeds to the semantic stage regardless of its own verdict. Secret leaks and semantic security issues are independent signals; both surface to the user in one pass.

## Execution (semantic stage)

Spawn one `/cook --<flag>` Agent per flag in parallel. Each agent receives:
- The resolved diff
- The subset of changed files that touch its domain

Collect `{ verdict, findings[] }` from each. Aggregate: mode verdict = worst across all agents AND Stage 0 findings.
