# EM Protocol

The five-step protocol plan-em runs end-to-end. Emit progress per § Progress emission in SKILL.md (`Step X/5 — <title>`). Ref paths (`refs/principles.md`, `refs/template-exec-table.md`) resolve relative to the skill root.

## Step-by-step protocol

---

**Step 1/5 — Validate and pre-flight**

**1a. Validate PRD path.** Must exist and match `features/prd-*/prd-*.md` (top-level) **or** `features/prd-*/prd-*/prd-*.md` (nested sub-PRD, e.g. `features/prd-2-habit-tracking/prd-2.1-streak-freeze/prd-2.1-streak-freeze.md`).
- Store the matched PRD's own parent directory as `$PRD_DIR`; write **every** artifact relative to `$PRD_DIR`, never a reconstructed `features/prd-[n]/`.
- Derive `n` = first numeric segment of that parent dir name (`prd-3-habit-tracking` → `n=3`; `prd-2.1-streak-freeze` → `n=2`, the parent's number for a sub-PRD).
- On failure: refuse, emit the rule, produce no output.

**1b. Mandatory pre-flight scan (devkit + PRD).** Devkit files live in `devkit/` (created by `/msg --init`); `CLAUDE.md` is at project root. Read all, in order:

| # | Source | Read for / action |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | `devkit/AHA.md` | Past learnings applicable to this PRD's domain/feature type. Note every directly-relevant entry. |
| 2 | `devkit/GLOSSARY.md` | Canonical term definitions. Flag PRD terms that deviate. |
| 3 | `devkit/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System constraints, existing layers, integration points. Note constraints affecting the PRD's features. |
| 4 | `CLAUDE.md` (root) | Tech-stack constraints, naming conventions, arch notes. Note conventions that constrain agent scope / eng choices this run. |
| 5 | `devkit/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` | Component registry. Per component note: which PRD features impact it, which reuse it unchanged, which need new data ingestion. Feeds the pre-flight report; constrains frontend agent scope. |
| 6 | `devkit/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` | Unresolved decisions overlapping this PRD's domain/features. Note each under a new **Open questions** section; if one directly blocks a feature, flag as a blocking gap. |
| 7 | Input PRD | **Via its digest slice, not full prose** (see below). |

**Item 7 — PRD digest slice.** Run the PRD-digest generator for plan-em's `plan` slice; consume the JSON it prints:

```bash
G=.claude/scripts/scan-prd-digest.py; [ -f "$G" ] || G="$HOME/.claude/scripts/scan-prd-digest.py"; python3 "$G" "<PRD path>" --slice plan
```

The `plan` slice returns `frontmatter` (incl. `platform`, `module`, `affects`, `depends_on`), `summary`, `features` (F-IDs + acceptance criteria verbatim), and `exec_table` — the inputs the roster and exec-table build consume (Steps 3–4). The generator re-parses the current PRD on every call → the slice is never stale and PRD prose stays canonical (see `.claude/skills/shared/refs/session-cache.md`). **Escape hatch:** if a pre-flight check needs prose the slice omits — User-flow narrative for a terminology/architecture-conflict finding, or a heading under the digest's `unparsed_sections` — read only that section's `prose_lines` range. Do **not** default to the whole PRD.

**Absent-file rule.**
- No `devkit/` → emit `devkit/ not found — run /msg --init to initialise the project first.` and **stop** (do not proceed to Step 2).
- `devkit/` exists but a file missing → emit `<filename> not found — run /msg --init to initialise the project first.` Proceed without it; do not create it.

**1c. Multi-PRD cross-reference — consume the certified graph, ask only on conflict (I3/D19).**

By the time plan-em runs, the PRD's cross-PRD graph is **already established** by two upstream mechanisms plan-em consumes silently — it does **not** re-ask what they already answered:
- **intake** graded sequencing into the `S:` cell (`S:now/next/later/blocked-by-#n`), positioning this PRD against the rest of the backlog.
- **plan-tune** verified the frontmatter graph in certification check 6 (`depends_on`/`affects` correctness + acyclicity) — a precondition already enforced by Step 2 for the product wave (and Step 4 for the build wave).

So the v1 per-relationship `AskUserQuestion` gate (Dependency / Breaking change / Overlap, three questions) is **deleted**. Instead:

1. **Fast scan via frontmatter** — run `bash ls features/prd-*/prd-*.md` excluding the input PRD's directory, read each prior PRD's `module`, `affects`, `depends_on`. Cross-check against the input's certified `depends_on`/`affects` and its codebase/feature scan.
2. **Ask only on a genuine conflict** — one `AskUserQuestion` fires **only** when the certified graph contradicts what the codebase/feature scan implies, e.g.:
   - the certified `depends_on` names a PRD whose surface this PRD's features plainly do **not** touch (a spurious edge), or
   - the feature scan reveals an **undeclared** overlap/breaking touch on a prior PRD not in `affects` (a missing edge the certifier didn't catch because it never touched an executable field).
   Options for a conflict: **Trust the certified graph** / **Amend the graph** (add/remove the edge — then apply the frontmatter writeback below) / **Stop and reconcile**.
3. **Expected on a clean run: zero relationship questions.** A PRD whose certified graph matches its scan proceeds silently.

**Frontmatter writeback (only when Step 2 above amended an edge, or `module` is blank):** `Edit` the input PRD's YAML frontmatter — add/remove the reconciled `depends_on`/`affects` IDs (merge, no duplicates); infer and set `module` if blank/placeholder; mirror an added breaking/overlap edge into the prior PRD's `affects`. On a clean run (no amendment) this is a no-op.

**1d. Write pre-flight report** to `$PRD_DIR/preflight.md` (create or overwrite), containing all findings in full:
- **Terminology deviations** — PRD terms not matching GLOSSARY.md
- **Architecture conflicts** — features contradicting/ignoring ARCHITECTURE.md
- **AHA.md warnings** — applicable past learnings
- **Design system impact** — components impacted, data-ingestion needs, new components required (from DESIGN-SYSTEM.md scan)
- **Multi-PRD findings** — dependencies, breaking changes, overlaps, each classified and actioned
- **PRD gaps** — sections too ambiguous/incomplete to map domains

Do not hold the full report in context. After writing, emit inline **only actionable findings** (those needing a decision before proceeding: blocking PRD gaps, architecture conflicts, multi-PRD questions). Suppress informational findings (AHA.md warnings, terminology notes, design-system observations) inline — they live in `preflight.md`, available on request.

---

**Step 2/5 — Certification precondition (product wave)**

Certification is a **precondition, not a choice** (D18). Before the **plan wave**, the product-side certification must have passed — plan-em runs it inline rather than asking. Without this, checks 1/2/3/6 would be advisory and an unenforced gate decays into documentation. Full sequence:

```
plan-em Step 2: certify product  →  plan wave (agents write eng + tickets)
plan-em Step 4 (build mode): certify eng  →  build wave
```

Read the PRD's `product-tuned:` frontmatter (from Step 1) **and** the §9 Plan tune findings ledger:
- `product-tuned: yes` **and** zero unresolved Critical findings in §9 → certified; proceed straight to agent identification.
- `product-tuned: no`/absent, **or** any Critical finding still `Open`/`Still open` in §9 → **run `plan-tune --product` inline**: `Skill("plan-tune", "$PRD_DIR/prd-[n]-[slug].md --product")` (the input PRD path resolved in Step 1a). The certifier auto-fixes Critical+Major, stamps `product-tuned: yes`, and terminates recommend-only. When it returns, re-read the frontmatter + §9:
  - Certified (stamp set, zero unresolved Criticals) → proceed to agent identification.
  - The certifier hit its **product-decision pause** (a fix needing a human product choice) → it already batched that question; once the user answers and the certifier finishes, re-check. If a Critical remains genuinely unresolved after the certifier ran, **stop** and surface it — plan-em never plans on an uncertified PRD.

No `AskUserQuestion` in this step — the certifier is autonomous and cheap; its own product-decision pause is the only stop.

---

**Step 3/5 — Identify agents and get approval**

**3a — Compile coding standards (flags) to confirm agent types.** Before proposing any roster, derive platform identifiers from the PRD frontmatter `platform` field and the Features & acceptance criteria table. Then call `/cook` **once per implied platform via explicit flags** — never a prose summary — using the stack→flag derivation in `.claude/skills/eng/refs/build/protocol.md` (§ Coding-standards flags): `--global` (mandatory, unscoped — guarantees the P0 floor) plus, for each platform, **diff-scoped domain sub-ref flags** rather than the bare domain flag.
- **Scope each domain, don't over-load.** A bare domain flag (`--macos`, `--react`) compiles the domain's `SKILL.md` **plus every** `refs/*.md` — the full shelf. Instead, mirror the eng derivation so the orchestrator-compiled payload is scoped too (both paths must agree — standalone `eng` and orchestrated runs): enumerate the domain's refs (`<cook>/standards/<domain>/refs/` or its `_INDEX.md` — never a hardcoded list), keep every ref by default, and **drop a ref only when the PRD/devkit provably excludes its subject** (e.g. `distribution.md` when `CLAUDE.md` defers distribution; `localization.md` with no i18n in scope; `sandbox-and-tcc.md` with no entitlements/sandbox). Signals: the exec-table **Files** column, the row **concerns**, and the devkit's provable exclusions. **Never under-load — missing a relevant standard is worse than loading an extra one:** on any uncertainty keep the ref, and if a whole domain can't be confidently scoped fall back to the **bare** domain flag (full shelf). Always keep the domain `SKILL.md` floor (emit the bare `--<domain>` flag to anchor it), then emit `--<domain>:<ref>` for each kept ref (e.g. `--global --macos --macos:architecture-and-state --macos:windows-and-scenes --macos:performance-accessibility --macos:hig-conventions`). This scoping applies to **domain** flags only; `--global` stays whole.
- Read each result fully and **retain the compiled payload per stack** — this is the *compile-once, share-many* standards payload injected into build subagents at Step 4. Cook is called **at most once per distinct stack per run** (a repeated identical flag set is a cache hit).
- A platform whose flags `/cook` accepts is covered; its flag names the canonical agent identifier (`eng-<platform>`). Do not derive agent names from the PRD alone — `/cook`'s flag set is the authority on supported platforms.
- If `/cook` has no flag for an implied platform (rejects the flag with the valid-flag list): surface as a blocking gap — emit a warning, list the uncovered platform, and ask via `AskUserQuestion` before continuing.

**3b — Propose language-targeted roster and get approval.** Map every PRD feature to the covered platforms from 3a. One agent per language/platform stack in scope. Do **not** collapse platforms to reduce count: `eng-ios` and `eng-android` own different codebases, toolchains, and integration concerns — never merge. An under-staffed roster produces a worse plan.

Present as a table:

| Agent | Domain | Scope summary | PRD features covered |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------------------|

Then ask approval via `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Approve roster** — proceed with agent activation.
- **Revise roster** — user provides changes; re-run 3b with the revision (do **not** re-fetch `/cook`).

Do not activate any agent without explicit approval.

**Execution table skeleton.** Once the roster is approved, build the skeleton using `refs/template-exec-table.md` as guide:
- Enumerate features from the PRD's Features & acceptance criteria table — the F-IDs there (F1, F2, …) are the canonical feature list and the key for every exec-table row.
- For each F-ID, enumerate applicable execution concerns (API contract, schema migration, authentication, webhooks/hooks, client implementation, tests) and create one row per `(feature, concern)` pair. Feature cell = exact `<F-ID>: <name> — <concern>` text.
- Pre-populate Feature and Agent columns; leave Execution steps blank.

**Todos column (always present).** Add a **Todos** column between Execution steps and Agent. Each cell is an anchor link to that feature's `### F<n>` subsection under `## Todos`: `[F<n>](#todos-f<n>)` (e.g. `[F1](#todos-f1)`). All rows sharing an F-ID point to the same anchor. Targets are written by the plan wave (Step 4 — the same pass that writes the engineering section) — this is a forward pointer.

Append the skeleton to the PRD:

```markdown
## Execution Table

| Feature | Execution steps | Todos | Agent |
|---------|----------------|-------|-------|
| F1: Set daily goal — API contract | | [F1](#todos-f1) | backend-eng |
```

**AHA.md update (conditional).** Before Step 4, capture a learning if any of: a PRD gap catchable in `plan-pm`; an architecture conflict that should inform future PRD templates; an overlap with a prior PRD that required a resolution decision. For each, append one entry under `## Entries` (most recent first) of `devkit/AHA.md`:

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] <Summary title>
**Why**: <Root cause>
**Note**: <Concrete action or warning for future runs>
```

Write only when ≥1 qualifying learning exists — never an empty entry.

---

**Step 4/5 — Agents write**

**Mode detection.** Scan PRD headings for `## Engineering —` blocks. The approved roster count = expected count for "all agents." Two modes:

| Condition | `$MODE` |
|-----------|---------|
| fewer `## Engineering —` blocks than roster agents (or none) | `plan` |
| `## Engineering —` present for **all** roster agents | `build` |

Each mode dispatches its agents to the `eng` skill with the matching flag (`--plan` / `--build`). The `plan` wave writes each agent's `## Engineering — <Agent>` section **and** its `## Todos — <Agent>` tickets in **one pass** — there is no separate todo wave.

**Subagent context injection (compile/read once, share many).** plan-em already read the full PRD + devkit (Step 1) and compiled per-stack standards payloads (Step 3a). It passes each `eng` subagent only what it needs, so siblings do **not** each re-read the whole PRD, re-read every devkit file, or re-invoke `/cook`. Every dispatch prompt below therefore also includes:
- **Scoped context** — this agent's exec-table rows, the PRD **feature sections** those rows map to, and a **devkit digest** (canonical GLOSSARY terms, ARCHITECTURE constraints, DESIGN-SYSTEM components relevant to the rows — distilled from the Step 1 pre-flight). Plus the **escape hatch**: *"The full PRD is at `<prd-path>`; read it (or a specific devkit file) on demand only if a scoped excerpt is insufficient to resolve a row."*
- **Standards payload** *(build mode only)* — the compiled `/cook` output for this agent's stack, retained from Step 3a. The build agent uses it and **does not call `/cook` itself**. (`--plan` agents pull no standards → no payload.)

Scope-enforcement and the branch contract in the numbered fields are unchanged — each agent acts only on its assigned rows and commits only to the resolved branch.

**Plan mode (`$MODE = plan`).** First, append the `## Todos` umbrella heading **once** (if absent) after the exec-table skeleton — the anchor namespace the exec-table Todos column points into (`#todos-f<n>`). Creating it here (not in the parallel agents) avoids a write race on the shared heading. Then activate each approved agent as a parallel subagent via the `Agent` tool, each running `eng` in `--plan` mode. Prompt fields:
1. "Read `.claude/skills/eng/SKILL.md` fully and follow its protocol."
2. Mode flag: `--plan`
3. `prd-path`: the PRD file path
4. `rows`: the semicolon-separated exec-table Feature identifiers assigned to this agent — each the exact `<ID>: <name> — <concern>` text of a Feature cell
5. `agent`: this agent's name from the approved roster — the exact **Agent** column value for these rows (e.g. `backend-eng`)
6. **Scoped context** (per § Subagent context injection): rows, the mapped PRD feature sections, devkit digest, PRD-path escape hatch. (`--plan` pulls no standards → no payload.)

Each agent writes its `## Engineering — <Agent>` section **and**, in the same pass, its `## Todos — <Agent>` block (one `### F<n>` per owned feature, under the `## Todos` umbrella — schema in `eng/refs/plan/template-todo.md`) directly to the PRD. Emit a short progress note per completion. When every agent has written both, the plan phase is complete and the next `plan-em` invocation detects `$MODE = build`.

**Build mode (`$MODE = build`).**

**Eng certification precondition (D18) — runs before any build agent.** The engineering sections exist now (the plan wave wrote them), so the eng-side certification is a precondition to the build wave, the same way the product cert (Step 2) gated the plan wave. This closes the v1 hole where synth merely *recommended* the eng tune — the build wave can no longer start on an uncertified eng plan. Read `eng-tuned:` + the §9 ledger:
- `eng-tuned: yes` **and** zero unresolved Critical findings → certified; proceed to branch resolution.
- `eng-tuned: no`/absent, **or** any unresolved Critical → **run `plan-tune --eng` inline**: `Skill("plan-tune", "$PRD_DIR/prd-[n]-[slug].md --eng")` (the input PRD path from Step 1a; the eng-side check set: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7). It auto-fixes Critical+Major, stamps `eng-tuned: yes`, terminates recommend-only. Re-read on return; if a Critical remains genuinely unresolved after it ran, **stop** and surface it — no build agent dispatches on an uncertified eng plan. No `AskUserQuestion` here (the certifier's own product-decision pause is the only stop).

Then, resolve and create the feature branch **once**.

**Branch resolution (parent-aware).** Read the PRD frontmatter for a `parent:` field (present only on sub-PRDs — see `plan-pm` § Sub-PRD mode):

| Frontmatter | `$BRANCH` | Note |
|-------------|-----------|------|
| No `parent:` (top-level PRD) | `feat/prd-[n]-<short-name>` (from this PRD's own id/title) | as before |
| `parent: prd-<parent-n>-<parent-slug>` (sub-PRD) | `feat/prd-<parent-n>-<parent-slug>` (parsed from `parent`) | sub-PRD **never** gets its own branch — commits land on the parent's feature branch, so `/pre-merge` sees its changes in the parent's existing run directory |

**Idempotent create-or-checkout.** Check `git branch --list "$BRANCH"`:
- Does **not** exist (common for a top-level PRD's first build) → cut it from `main` and push it.
- **Already exists** — before reusing it, check whether it has already merged to `main`: run `git branch --merged main` and test whether `$BRANCH` appears in the output.
  - **Not yet merged** (common for a sub-PRD whose parent branch is still in flight) → check it out; do **not** re-create or reset.
  - **Already merged** (the parent's feature branch has shipped) → do **not** reuse it — committing new work onto a shipped branch would merge it to `main` a second time. Cut a **fresh** branch instead, named from this PRD's own id/slug (for a sub-PRD use the sub-PRD's own id, e.g. `feat/prd-2.1-streak-freeze`), from `main`, and push it. Set `$BRANCH` to that fresh name for the build agents.

Build agents run in parallel and must not each try to create it (concurrent creation from `main` corrupts the tree) — they hard-fail if it is missing. Then activate each approved agent as a parallel subagent, each running `eng` in `--build` mode. Prompt fields:
1. "Read `.claude/skills/eng/SKILL.md` fully and follow its protocol."
2. Mode flag: `--build`
3. `prd-path`: the PRD file path (engineering sections already appended)
4. `rows`: the semicolon-separated exec-table Feature identifiers assigned to this agent — each the exact `<ID>: <name> — <concern>` text of a Feature cell
5. `branch`: `$BRANCH` (resolved/created above — the parent's branch for a sub-PRD)
6. `agent`: this agent's name from the approved roster — the exact **Agent** column value for these rows (e.g. `backend-eng`)
7. **Scoped context + standards payload** (per § Subagent context injection): rows, the mapped PRD feature sections, devkit digest, PRD-path escape hatch, **and** the compiled `/cook` **standards payload** for this agent's stack (retained from Step 3a). The build agent uses the injected payload and **does not call `/cook` itself**; cook is invoked at most once per distinct stack per run.

Emit a short progress note per completion.

**Plan-mode branch suggestion.** After all plan sections are appended, derive the short feature name from the PRD title (lowercase, hyphenated, ≤ 4 words) and emit the suggested working branch:

```
feat/prd-[n]-<short-name>
```

Engineers should cut this branch from `main` before starting work.

---

**Step 5/5 — Synthesise and next steps**

**Synthesise.** Read the engineering sections + feature coverage via the digest **synth** slice — `python3 .claude/scripts/scan-prd-digest.py <prd-path> --slice synth` (frontmatter + `features` + `exec_table` + every agent's `engineering` block + `open_questions` — everything this synthesis summarizes). **Escape hatch:** for a cross-section conflict that needs product prose (a user-flow or design-system detail), read only that section's `prose_lines` range; do **not** default to reading the whole PRD. Produce a synthesis report inline:
1. **Per-agent summary** — per engineering section: one paragraph on what was written, decided, and left open.
2. **Numbered findings list** — every gap/conflict/open question across all sections, each with:
   - Severity: **Critical** (blocks engineering kickoff) / **Major** (requires mid-flight PRD revision) / **Minor** (note for future cycles)
   - Location: PRD section and owning agent
   - Required action: what must happen before engineering work begins

   Critical synth findings are **batched, not a blocking terminal gate** (I5) — collect them into one `AskUserQuestion` (≤4 per call, same pause shape as the certifier's product-decision pause and plan-pm's open-questions pause), apply the resolutions, then continue. A Critical that the certifier should have caught (an uncertified-field contract break) is a signal the eng precondition (Step 4) was skipped — re-run it rather than hand-patching here.
3. **Suggested branch** — derive the short feature name from the PRD title (lowercase, hyphenated, ≤ 4 words). Emit per the convention in `.claude/skills/eng/refs/plan/template-eng-plan.md` §10:

   ```
   feat/prd-[n]-<short-name>
   ```

   Example: `feat/prd-3-habit-tracking`. Engineers cut this from `main` before starting work.

**Next steps.** After synthesis, ask via `AskUserQuestion` (single-select) "What would you like to do next?" — options depend on the phase just completed (`$MODE` from Step 4).

**After the `plan` phase:**

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Run eng --build** — begin the build phase using this PRD | invoke `Skill("plan-em", "<prd-path>")`. plan-em re-runs mode detection: engineering sections present for all agents → `$MODE = build`. The eng certification precondition (Step 4) auto-runs `plan-tune --eng` before dispatch — it is **no longer a menu item** (I2). |
| **Skip** — terminate plan-em with no further action | terminate immediately. |

The v1 "Run plan-tune (eng mode)" menu option is **deleted** — the eng tune is now the build-wave precondition (Step 4), auto-run inline, not a thing the user selects. Running eng --build certifies the eng plan on the way in.

Final state: the PRD contains all engineering sections plus a `## Todos` section with a `## Todos — <Agent>` block per agent (written in the same plan pass), the synthesis is visible, no Critical findings are unresolved, and the suggested branch is emitted.
