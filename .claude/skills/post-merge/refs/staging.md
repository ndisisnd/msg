# `--staging` — merge to staging, hand off to a human

Runs after `/pre-merge` opened a `feature → staging` PR. Post-merge merges it on
green CI, deploys, verifies the deploy with the platform's smoke check, hands a
human a test script, and — only on the human's explicit approval — stamps the
sign-off that `--production` requires. Post-merge **never self-certifies
staging**: Step 6 STOPS and waits for a human.

## Step 1 — Branch protection

Per `refs/protection.md`: `post-merge-protection.sh --verify staging`. Anything
but `PROTECTED staging` refuses (`refs/refusal-patterns.md` → `unprotected`).

## Step 2 — Locate the PR + verify green CI

1. Resolve the feature branch: from `--prd`'s `feat/prd-<n>-<slug>`, else the current branch, else the single open `--base staging` PR.
2. Find the PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --base staging --head "<feature-branch>" --state open \
     --json number,headRefName,url,statusCheckRollup --limit 1
   ```
   No open PR → refuse (`no_pr`) — pre-merge hasn't opened one, or it already merged.
3. **Verify CI is green.** Branch protection is the machine enforcement; this is
   post-merge's own check so it can refuse with a clear reason rather than a raw
   merge rejection. Inspect `statusCheckRollup` (or
   `gh pr checks <number> --json name,state`):
   - Any check `state` in `FAILURE`/`ERROR`/`CANCELLED` → refuse (`red_ci`), listing each failing check name.
   - Any check still `PENDING`/`IN_PROGRESS`/`QUEUED` → refuse (`pending_ci`), listing the pending checks. Do not wait/poll — the human re-runs post-merge when CI settles.
   - All `SUCCESS`/`NEUTRAL`/`SKIPPED` → proceed.

## Step 3 — Merge into staging

This is post-merge's sanctioned merge power (the pre-merge floor forbids it for
every other skill):

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --merge --delete-branch=false
```

Use `--merge` (a real merge commit — preserves the feature history on staging);
never `--squash`/`--rebase` unless the user asks. On merge failure (protection
rejected it, conflict) → refuse (`merge_failed`) with gh's message. Record the
merge commit sha.

## Step 4 — Deploy staging

Per `refs/deploy.md` (`staging_deploy_cmd` from `devkit/PLATFORMS.md`).

## Step 5 — Verify the deploy

Per `refs/verify-deploy.md`: run each platform's `smoke_cmd` against the deployed
staging target. Verified (or skipped-with-note) → continue. **Smoke failure** →
emit the `smoke-failed` finding, set verdict `fail`, and **stop here** — skip
Steps 6–7. Never hand a human a test script for an environment that is already
failing its own health check; the report points at fixing forward via
`/pre-merge` (the merge stands).

## Step 6 — Human test script + STOP

Per `refs/human-test-script.md`. Emit the script and **stop the autonomous
flow** — a human must exercise staging. Post-merge does not proceed to Step 7 on
its own.

## Step 7 — Stamp the sign-off (on explicit approval)

Only after the human returns. Ask once:

> `AskUserQuestion` — header **Staging**, question "Did staging pass your testing?"
> - **Staging works** — stamp the sign-off and finish
> - **Not yet** — leave unstamped; re-run `--staging` (or fix + re-gate) later

On **Staging works**, stamp the PRD frontmatter (the harness-readable half of
D11 — `--production` Step 1 reads it, the GUI ladder reads it):

- Key: `staging-signoff`, value: today's date, `date -u +%Y-%m-%d` (`<YYYY-MM-DD>`).
- Idempotent: if the key exists, overwrite its value; else append it inside the `---` frontmatter block.
- Write only the frontmatter line — never touch the PRD body.

```bash
# resolve today once
SIGNOFF_DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
```

Frontmatter edit shape (preserve every other line verbatim):

```yaml
staging-signoff: 2026-07-13
```

On **Not yet**, do not stamp; note it in the run report and stop.

## Run report

Write `report-[n].md` (`../shared/refs/report-schema.md`, `skill: post-merge`)
to the PRD's `reports/` dir. Staging flavor:

- `verdict: pass` when merged + (deployed or deploy-skipped-with-note) + (smoke verified or verify-skipped-with-note); `fail` on a smoke failure (Step 5); `n/a` if it refused before merging.
- Body `## Test results` — one line per platform: verified / smoke-failed / skipped (no `smoke_cmd`), per `refs/verify-deploy.md`.
- Body `## What to expect` — staging is live at the deploy target; production still gated on sign-off + double-confirm.
- Body `## How to verify` — **the human test script verbatim** (Step 6) so the GUI Reports tab surfaces it.
- `## Links` — the merged PR, the merge commit, the deploy log/target, the smoke log.
