# `--staging` — merge to staging, hand off to a human

Runs after `/pre-merge` opened a `feature → staging` PR. Post-merge merges it on
green CI, deploys, verifies the deploy with the platform's smoke check, hands a
human a test script, and — only on the human's explicit approval — stamps the
sign-off that `--production` requires. Post-merge **never self-certifies
staging**: Step 6 STOPS and waits for a human.

## Step 1 — Branch protection (policy-conditional)

Per `refs/protection.md` + `../shared/refs/policy-schema.md` §2. Resolve
`mode_staging = overrides[staging] ?? branch_protection.mode ?? "enforced"` (no file
→ `enforced` = today), then `post-merge-protection.sh --verify staging`: `enforced` →
`UNPROTECTED` **refuses** (`refs/refusal-patterns.md` → `unprotected`); `optional` →
`UNPROTECTED` **warns + proceeds** (one `low` note); `skip` → don't verify. `NO_GH` /
`NO_REMOTE` **refuse regardless of mode**.

## Staging-readiness guard (pre-flight, after Step 1)

Before locating the PR, read the `staging_ready` record `--init` wrote
(`../shared/refs/policy-schema.md` §5) — verify staging is a **real environment**,
not just a branch. Resolve `mode = policies.staging_readiness.mode ?? "enforced"`
(mirrors `branch_protection`'s stance + default). Then:

- **Record absent** (pre-C9 init, or the repo was never `/post-merge --init`ed) →
  add **one `low` note** to the run report — *"staging readiness was never
  recorded; run `/post-merge --init` to verify the staging environment"* — and
  **proceed**. Never refuse solely because the record predates C9.
- **Present, every shipping platform `ready:true`** → proceed silently.
- **Present, any platform with `gaps[]`:**
  - `enforced` → **refuse** (`refs/refusal-patterns.md` → `staging_unready`),
    listing each unready platform's gaps and its exact fix verbatim from the
    record. The merge has not happened yet — refusing here is the whole point:
    surface the gap before deploying into an environment that was never set up.
  - `optional` → **warn + proceed**, one `low` note per unready platform.
  - `skip` → don't guard (record "staging-readiness check skipped by policy").

This guard only bites under `release_flow=staged`; in `direct` flow `--staging`
has already refused `no_staging_stage` (there is no staging to check).

`staging_ready` is a **resolved fact** re-derived at each `--init`, so it can go
**stale** between init and this run (a platform's declared artifacts changed since
readiness was last derived) — D14 accepts this (the record reflects the last
`--init`, not live state; re-run `/post-merge --init` to refresh it).

## In-flight-production check (pre-flight, before Step 2) — C8

A `--staging` merge lands new commits on `staging` **while** a `--production` run
may be mid-flight — the exact race the release lock names. If a production ship has
already opened its `staging→main` PR (Step 4) and is between merge and verify,
merging into `staging` now advances the branch the release is shipping: the PR
silently grows past what the human double-confirmed, and past the commit the
sign-off certified — **reopening C2's uncertified-commit hole at the concurrency
level**. So `--staging` **reads** the production release lock and refuses if one is
held (`../shared/refs/policy-schema.md` §6):

```bash
PROD=${prod_branch:-main}; LOCK="release-lock-$PROD"
git fetch origin "refs/tags/$LOCK:refs/tags/$LOCK" --force --quiet 2>/dev/null
git rev-parse -q --verify "refs/tags/$LOCK" >/dev/null   # exists ⇒ a production release holds the lock
```

- **Lock held, not stale** (age ≤ 2h) → **refuse** `release_in_flight`
  (`refs/refusal-patterns.md`), naming the in-flight production run (holder/when/sha
  from the tag message). The merge has not happened — refusing here keeps the
  running release's certified window intact. Wait for it to finish, then re-run.
- **Lock held, stale** (age > 2h) → same stale handling as `--production`: a terminal
  `release_in_flight` (stale variant) that **prints the one-line manual unlock**,
  never a blind permanent refusal:
  > **Release lock is stale** — held by `<holder>` since `<at>` (> 2h ago), likely an
  > aborted run. If no release is actually in flight, clear it and re-run:
  > `git push origin :refs/tags/release-lock-<prod>`  (then `git tag -d release-lock-<prod>` locally)
- **No lock** → proceed to Step 2.

This lock read closes the race from the **staging side** — a staging merge that would
start *while* a production ship holds the lock. The **reverse** window — a `--staging`
merge that landed *before* the production run acquired the lock — is closed from the
**production side**: `--production` re-verifies sign-off coverage immediately after
acquiring the lock and refuses `stale_signoff` on drift (`refs/production.md`
§ *Re-verify sign-off coverage immediately after acquire*).

**Asymmetric by design:** `--staging` **reads** the lock but never **acquires** one.
A staging merge (a single `gh pr merge`) is near-atomic — the reverse window (a
production ship starting mid-staging-merge) is sub-second and not worth the machinery
or the friction (AC-LK3). The production ship is the long-lived hold; it is the only
acquirer.

## Step 2 — Locate the PR + verify green CI

1. Resolve the feature branch: from `--prd`'s `feat/prd-<n>-<slug>`, else the current branch, else the single open `--base staging` PR.
2. Find the PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --base staging --head "<feature-branch>" --state open \
     --json number,headRefName,url,statusCheckRollup --limit 1
   ```
   No open PR → refuse (`no_pr`) — pre-merge hasn't opened one, or it already merged.
3. **Verify CI is green.** Branch protection is the machine enforcement; this is
   post-merge's own check so it can refuse with a clear reason rather than a raw
   merge rejection. Inspect `statusCheckRollup` (or
   `gh pr checks <number> --json name,state`):
   - Any check `state` in `FAILURE`/`ERROR`/`CANCELLED` → refuse (`red_ci`), listing each failing check name.
   - Any check still `PENDING`/`IN_PROGRESS`/`QUEUED` → refuse (`pending_ci`), listing the pending checks. Do not wait/poll — the human re-runs post-merge when CI settles.
   - **Empty check set** (the PR reports *zero* checks — no CI pipeline ran) → don't treat "no red" as green. First resolve `ga = policies.github_actions.enabled ?? true` (`policy-schema.md` §2b):
     - `ga:false` → **CI is inactive by the user's own choice** (no Actions minutes / no Pro plan / CI lives elsewhere). Proceed silently: no `vacuous-ci` note, no `/pre-merge --init` nudge. Record one report line — "GitHub Actions disabled by policy (`<reason>`) — change with `/msg --update`" — and nothing else.
     - `ga:true`/absent → resolve `steps.ci` per `policy-schema.md` §3: `ready` → emit one `low` `vacuous-ci` note (a workflow was expected but nothing ran — likely a broken or missing `.github/workflows/` pipeline; run `/pre-merge --init`) and proceed; `opted_out`/`n/a` → the empty set is intentional, proceed silently; `missing`/`deferred`/absent → proceed as today.

     Never blocks the merge — branch protection is the enforcement. Note the opt-out governs *only* the empty set: the two bullets above still refuse on red/pending checks whatever `ga` says.
   - All `SUCCESS`/`NEUTRAL`/`SKIPPED` → proceed.

## Test-selection-miss detection (`policies.test_selection` backstop attribution)

Read-only, additive, and only relevant when `policies.test_selection.enabled`
resolves `true` (`../shared/refs/policy-schema.md` §2c) — otherwise nothing in
this section is read, per the same dead-config rule every other selection
artifact follows (AC-TS12). When it's on, pre-merge's minified runs traded
full-suite coverage for speed on the promise that the full suite still runs
somewhere — the declared `full_run_backstop` (`ci` \| `post-merge` \| `both`).
This is where that promise is checked: a test the minified run **selected away**
breaking at the backstop is the false-green risk the plan calls out, and it must
be observable, not anecdotal (AC-TS9).

**`ci` backstop — off the Step 2 `red_ci` check just above.** When Step 2 finds a
failing check, resolve the pre-merge run that produced this PR's head commit and
read its `test_selection` block (`../../pre-merge/refs/output-schema.md`) — the
committed universal report in the PRD's `reports/` folder carries it verbatim
(`../shared/refs/report-schema.md` § *`test_selection` in the paired `.json`*, the
durable source; the verdict JSON itself is stdout and doesn't survive the run). For each
failing check name that names a test:

- Look up that test's owning component (`unit`/`integration`/`regression`) in
  `test_selection.per_check`.
- That component ran minified (`selected < total`, a `fallback_reason` absent for
  it) **and** the failing test isn't among the ones it selected → this is a
  genuine miss: the minified run never exercised the test that just broke.
- Record a `high` finding — category the owning component when the closed
  category vocabulary has a slot for it (`unit`/`integration`; a `regression`
  miss uses `other` by the deliberate convention in `refs/output-schema.md`
  § *Test-selection-miss finding*), `rule: "test-selection-miss"` — naming the failing
  test, its file, and the exclusion reason read straight off the
  `test_selection` block: `not-affected` (excluded by the affected-diff rule),
  `not-tagged` (no critical marker, so a widened tier still passed over it), or
  `tier` (the resolved size tier's own contract excluded it, e.g. `integration`
  at tier M). This finding is **additive** to the `red_ci` refusal already in
  play — it explains the refusal, it never manufactures a new one or turns a
  green run red on its own.
- Component ran full (it **carries** a `fallback_reason` — the rule fell back —
  or `selected == total`, or it has no `per_check` entry at all) → this is an
  ordinary regression, not a selection miss; no finding here. Note the polarity:
  a `fallback_reason` **present** means that component ran the full suite;
  **absent** means it genuinely ran minified
  (`../../pre-merge/refs/output-schema.md`).

**`post-merge`/`both` backstop — Step 7's human test outcome.** The full suite
here is the human exercising staging, so attribution is necessarily coarser: on
**Not yet** at Step 7, if the human's answer names a specific broken behaviour
that maps to a known test (by name, or by the acceptance criterion it covers),
attribute it the same way — read the same PR's `test_selection` block and record
the `high` finding if that test was selected away. An unattributable **Not
yet** (no specific test named) changes nothing about today's behaviour — still
just an unstamped sign-off — plus one `low` note: "staging failed testing while
test_selection is enabled; consider whether a selected-away test caused it."

**Rolling-window escalation.** Count `test-selection-miss` findings across this
PRD's committed reports plus the rest of the repo's
`features/**/reports/report-*.json`, restricted to the most recent 30 days.
**Two or more misses in that window** → the run report adds one line
recommending `/pre-merge --update-criticality` (tag the escapee critical so it
stops being selected away) or `/msg --update` to disable `policies.test_selection`
outright, and names the escapee's test **file** as a `force_full_paths` candidate
(`../shared/refs/policy-schema.md` §`policies.test_selection.force_full_paths`) —
a cross-cutting-enough surface that selection should stop trying to prune around
it. A single miss stays a plain finding with no escalation line; the
recommendation only fires once a second one lands.

## Step 3 — Merge into staging

This is post-merge's sanctioned merge power (the pre-merge floor forbids it for
every other skill):

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --merge --delete-branch=false
```

Use `--merge` (a real merge commit — preserves the feature history on staging);
never `--squash`/`--rebase` unless the user asks. On merge failure (protection
rejected it, conflict) → refuse (`merge_failed`) with gh's message. Record the
merge commit sha.

**This sha is the certified sha.** It is what Step 4 deploys, what the human
tests in Step 6, and what Step 7 pins the sign-off to. Resolve it once, in full
40-char form, and carry it through the run:

```bash
git fetch origin staging --quiet
CERTIFIED_SHA=$(git rev-parse origin/staging)   # == the merge commit just created
```

## Step 4 — Deploy staging

Per `refs/deploy.md` (`staging_deploy_cmd` from `devkit/PLATFORMS.md`).

## Step 5 — Verify the deploy

Per `refs/verify-deploy.md`: run each platform's smoke against the deployed staging
target — the **v2 smoke contract** (`smoke: {cmd, watch_window?, poll?}`): a bare
`smoke_cmd` is one-shot (unchanged); a declared `poll` waits for a late-live target
first, a declared `watch_window` re-checks health after it passes. Verified (or
skipped-with-note) → continue. **Any smoke failure** — a plain non-zero, a poll
timeout (`smoke-never-live`), or a watch-window degrade — emits the finding, sets
verdict `fail`, and **stops here** — skip Steps 6–7. Never hand a human a test
script for an environment that is already failing its own health check; the report
points at fixing forward via `/pre-merge` (the merge stands). For a macOS platform,
the config-gated notarization / signing / appcast checks (`refs/verify-deploy.md`
§ *macOS release checks*) run here too — each a distinct finding, silent when
undeclared.

## Step 6 — Human test script + STOP

Per `refs/human-test-script.md`. Emit the script and **stop the autonomous
flow** — a human must exercise staging. Post-merge does not proceed to Step 7 on
its own.

## Step 7 — Stamp the sign-off (on explicit approval)

Only after the human returns. Ask once:

> `AskUserQuestion` — header **Staging**, question "Did staging pass your testing?"
> - **Staging works** — stamp the sign-off and finish
> - **Not yet** — leave unstamped; re-run `--staging` (or fix + re-gate) later

On **Staging works**, stamp the PRD frontmatter (the harness-readable half of
D11 — `--production` Step 1 reads it, the GUI ladder reads it):

- Key: `staging-signoff`, value: `<YYYY-MM-DD>@<sha>` — today's date **and the
  certified sha** (Step 3's `CERTIFIED_SHA`, full 40 chars). The sha is what
  makes the stamp verifiable: `--production` Step 1 refuses if `staging` has
  advanced past every stamped sha, so commits merged after sign-off cannot ride
  to production uncertified (AC-SO1).
- Idempotent: if the key exists, overwrite its value; else append it inside the `---` frontmatter block.
- Write only the frontmatter line — never touch the PRD body.

```bash
# resolve both halves once
SIGNOFF_DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
SIGNOFF="${SIGNOFF_DATE}@${CERTIFIED_SHA}"       # CERTIFIED_SHA from Step 3
```

Frontmatter edit shape (preserve every other line verbatim):

```yaml
staging-signoff: 2026-07-13@4f2c9a1e8b7d6c5a4938271605f4e3d2c1b0a9f8
```

**Never stamp a sha other than the one that was deployed and tested.** If
`git rev-parse origin/staging` no longer equals `CERTIFIED_SHA` at stamp time,
something landed on `staging` during the human's test window: still stamp
`CERTIFIED_SHA` (that is what the human actually tested) and add a `low` note to
the run report naming the commits that arrived after it — they are uncertified
and `--production` will say so.

On **Not yet**, do not stamp; note it in the run report and stop.

## Run report

Write `report-prd-<N>-<K>.md` (`../shared/refs/report-schema.md`, `skill: post-merge`)
to the PRD's `reports/` dir. Staging flavor:

- `verdict: pass` when merged + (deployed or deploy-skipped-with-note) + (smoke verified or verify-skipped-with-note); `fail` on a smoke failure (Step 5); `n/a` if it refused before merging.
- Body `## Test results` — one line per platform per `refs/verify-deploy.md`'s full vocabulary: for `deploy` platforms — verified / smoke-failed / smoke-never-live (poll timeout) / degraded-in-window (watch-window) / skipped (no `smoke_cmd`); for `submission` platforms — submitted (+ track) / backend-health-ok / backend-health-failed / skipped, never "live".
- Body `## What to expect` — per `release_model`: `deploy` platforms — staging is live at the deploy target; `submission` platforms — **submitted to the internal/TestFlight track, not "live"** (`refs/submission.md`). Production still gated on sign-off + double-confirm.
- Body `## How to verify` — **the human test script verbatim** (Step 6) so the GUI Reports tab surfaces it.
- `## Links` — the merged PR, the merge commit, the deploy log/target, the smoke log.
