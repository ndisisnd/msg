  One-time project bootstrap. Scans the working directory, asks 3–4
  questions about the project, then creates any missing foundational
  files: AHA.md, GLOSSARY.md, README.md, .gitignore, CLAUDE.md,
  ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN-SYSTEM.md, CHANGELOG.md, OPEN-QUESTIONS.md,
  and the features/ directory. Idempotent — skips files that already exist; never
  overwrites. All other msg skills read these files but never create
  them.

# msg-init

## Usage

**Invoke**: `/msg-init` — optionally pass a one-line project brief as input.

- Slash command `/msg-init`
- Natural language: "initialise project", "bootstrap repo", "set up the framework", "start a new project", "init the msg framework"
- Context: empty or near-empty repository where the user asks Claude to set up project structure
- Hand-off from another msg skill (e.g. `plan-pm`) when `AHA.md` or `GLOSSARY.md` is missing

**Hard refusals:**
- Working directory is not a git repository: emit a warning and ask the user to confirm via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding. Do not block — proceed if confirmed.

## Inputs

| Name | Format | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Working directory state | `key=value` lines from `init-setup.sh` | `init-setup.sh` at Step 1 |
| Project metadata | Interview answers | `AskUserQuestion` at Step 2 |
| Optional brief | Free text | User message at invocation |

## Outputs

| Name | Format | Destination |
|------|--------|-------------|
| AHA.md | Markdown from `refs/template-AHA.md` | `<cwd>/AHA.md` |
| GLOSSARY.md | Markdown from `refs/template-GLOSSARY.md` | `<cwd>/GLOSSARY.md` |
| README.md | Markdown from `refs/template-README.md`, customised with project name | `<cwd>/README.md` |
| .gitignore | Plain text from `refs/template-gitignore.md`, stack-specific | `<cwd>/.gitignore` |
| CLAUDE.md | Markdown from `refs/template-CLAUDE.md`, customised with platform | `<cwd>/CLAUDE.md` |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Markdown from `refs/template-ARCHITECTURE.md`, customised with platform | `<cwd>/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| DESIGN-SYSTEM.md | Markdown from `refs/template-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`, customised with project name | `<cwd>/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` |
| CHANGELOG.md | Markdown from `refs/template-CHANGELOG.md`, written and updated by subagents | `<cwd>/CHANGELOG.md` |
| OPEN-QUESTIONS.md | Markdown from `refs/template-OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`, written by build subagents for unresolved ambiguity | `<cwd>/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` |
| features/ | Empty directory | `<cwd>/features/` |
| .skillsrc | YAML for agent-skills-standard (conditional on framework detection) | `<cwd>/.skillsrc` |
| Manifest | Inline table — file, status, line count | Shown inline at Step 5 |

## Progress emission

Emit `Step X/5 — <title>` at the start of each step, unconditionally.

## Step-by-step protocol

**Step 1/5 — Scan the working directory**

Run `init-setup.sh` via Bash:

```
<skill_dir>/init-setup.sh "<cwd>"
```

Parse the five `key=value` lines it prints and hold `PRESENT`, `MISSING`, and `STACK_DEFAULT` in conversation context.

If `ALL_COMPLETE=true`, emit `All foundational files exist — nothing to initialise.` and stop. Skip every later step.

**Step 2/5 — Interview**

Run 4–5 `AskUserQuestion` prompts, one at a time. Skip Q2 when exactly one stack hint is present (platform is unambiguous).

| Q | Question | Format |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Project name and one-line description? | Free text |
| 2 | Primary platform or stack? | 4 options + Other: Web (frontend), Mobile (iOS/Android), Backend API, CLI |
| 2b | What is the primary language or framework? (e.g. Flutter, Go, React, NestJS, Swift) | Free text |
| 3 | Team type? | 4 options + Other: Solo, Small team (<5), Cross-functional, Open source |
| 4 | Any house conventions already in place? | Free text or "None yet" |

Hold every answer in conversation context.

**Step 3/5 — Generate missing files**

Run `init.sh` via Bash, passing interview answers as env vars and the working directory as the positional argument:

```
PROJECT_NAME="<Q1 name>" \
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION="<Q1 description>" \
PLATFORM="<Q2 answer>" \
LANGUAGE="<Q2b answer>" \
TEAM_TYPE="<Q3 answer>" \
CONVENTIONS="<Q4 answer>" \
<skill_dir>/init.sh "<cwd>"
```

`init.sh` handles all template extraction, placeholder substitution, gitignore stack selection, `features/` creation, and idempotency. Capture its stdout — it includes the manifest for Step 5.

**Coding standards install**

After `init.sh` exits 0, run:

```
LANGUAGE="<Q2b answer>" \
PLATFORM="<Q2 answer>" \
<skill_dir>/install-standards.sh "<cwd>"
```

The script: checks npm is available (installs via nvm / Homebrew / apt if not), derives the framework key from LANGUAGE + PLATFORM, writes `.skillsrc`, and runs `agent-skills-standard sync --yes`. It exits 0 with a skip message if the language has no mapping or `.skillsrc` already exists.

**Step 4/5 — Verify**

`init.sh` exits non-zero and marks failures in the manifest if any write fails. If the script exits non-zero, surface its stderr and stop. Do not retry — the user re-runs or fixes manually.

**Step 5/5 — Emit manifest and suggest next step**

Print the manifest from `init.sh` stdout verbatim. Then emit a one-line next-step suggestion:

> Next: run `/plan-pm` to draft the first PRD.

Do not invoke another skill. The next slash command is the user's choice.
