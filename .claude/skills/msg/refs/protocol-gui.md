# Protocol — `--gui`

Build and serve a **local-only** GUI over the PRDs under `features/` — resolved
lane-agnostically across `features/{planned,wip,done}/prd-*/` and the legacy flat
`features/prd-*/`: a Kanban/Table board of PRDs
→ per-PRD detail page (rendered PRD body + a TODOs section with its own Kanban/Table
toggle and a side panel), an **Intake** view (a backlog board over root `INTAKE.md`, shown
when that file exists), a **Roadmap** view (phases-as-lanes over `roadmap/roadmap.md`,
shown when that file exists), a **Files** view over the project's docs (README, CLAUDE.md,
`devkit/`), and — in interactive mode — a **Prompts** console that runs Claude against the
project. The surface lives in `refs/gui/` (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `server.py`); this
protocol only launches or fills it.

Dispatched from `msg/SKILL.md` on `/msg --gui`, the bare word `/msg gui`, or a
natural-language board/kanban/visualise request. Skip the picker entirely — go straight to
serving; do not call `AskUserQuestion`.

---

## Two modes, one template

| Mode | How it runs | What works |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Interactive (default)** | `refs/gui/server.py` serves the board and a JSON API | Everything below **plus** editing: PRD body editor, status changes (dropdown + drag-and-drop between columns), todo done-toggling (checkbox + drag between Open/Done), the Prompts console, live Files view, data refresh after every write |
| **Static (fallback)** | template + data-fill, served by any dumb file server | Read-only board: Kanban/Table, detail pages, rendered markdown preview, filter/sort, Test Issues. All editing UI stays hidden because no `/api/ping` answers |

The same `index.html` implements both: at boot it pings `api/ping`; a response flips it
into live mode, no response leaves it read-only. **Default to interactive mode**; fall back
to static only when `python3` is unavailable or the user asks for a read-only snapshot.

## Step 1 — Interactive mode (default)

1. Launch the server from the project root (run in background, note PID + URL):

   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/msg/refs/gui/server.py --root . --port 0
   ```

   `--port 0` picks a free port; the chosen URL is printed on stdout. Optional:
   `--runner '<cmd template>'` overrides how Prompts are executed (default
   `claude -p {prompt} --permission-mode acceptEdits`, run argv-safe with the project root
   as cwd — never through a shell).

2. Open the default browser at the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`. If the browser
   can't be opened, print the URL so the user can open it manually (error case 3).

3. Tear the server down when the user says they're done, or after a short idle timeout
   (criterion 9). Note the PID/URL so it can be stopped cleanly.

The server owns everything the agent used to do at generation time: it parses PRDs
(Step 3's contract), infers completion, fills the template **in memory** on every page
load, and re-parses on every `/api/data` call — so external edits (including ones made by
a Prompts run) appear on refresh. Nothing generated is ever written into the repo.

### Interactive surface — what the API allows

- **Edit a PRD body** — `POST /api/prd/save {path, body}` rewrites everything after the
  frontmatter of that PRD's `prd-*.md`. Frontmatter is preserved verbatim.
- **Change status** — `POST /api/prd/meta {path, key, value}`, editable keys:
  `completion | status | module | platform | feature`. Setting `completion` writes a
  frontmatter `completion:` override — see Step 2's inference ladder (the override is its
  top rung). Drag-and-drop between board columns and the detail-page dropdown both use this.
- **Toggle a todo** — `POST /api/todo/toggle {prd, id, done}` sets a `- **done:** true|false`
  field on that ticket's block under `## Todos` (additive: a field the todo schema tolerates
  and `--build` ignores). **Issue-tickets are never toggleable** — their done-state is
  `followUp.status`, owned by `eng --build`; the GUI only renders it.
- **Set an intake row's status** — `POST /api/intake/status {num, status}` rewrites the
  `status` cell of the row whose `#` equals `num` in the root `INTAKE.md` table (`status` ∈
  `backlog | in-progress | completed`, D14). This is the **only new write path in v2** (H5):
  the server edits that one cell in place, preserving every other cell and row verbatim — the
  same in-place-markdown model as the PRD-board writes. The Intake tab's lane drag and its
  per-card status buttons both call it. **No other INTAKE.md cell is writable** — `idea`,
  `goal`, `grade`, and the `prd` mapping are owned by `intake`/`plan-pm`, never the GUI. The
  byte-preservation obligation this write carries is simpler than it looks: since the
  `## Update log` moved out to its own file (`INTAKE-UPDATE.md`, C11), `INTAKE.md` never
  carries a second, independently-written region for the status rewrite to preserve around —
  `server.py` doesn't read or write `INTAKE-UPDATE.md` at all, and never will need to for this
  endpoint to stay correct.
- **Run a prompt** — `POST /api/prompt {prompt}` starts a background job via the runner
  template; `GET /api/jobs` returns status + output tails and the GUI polls while a run is
  live, then refreshes board data. Quick actions prefill skill invocations (`/plan-pm …`,
  `/eng --build …`); todo/issue side panels offer "Ask Claude about this" with context
  prefilled.
- **View project docs** — `GET /api/files` lists root `*.md` (README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG…)
  and `devkit/*.md`, grouped; `GET /api/file?path=…` returns one file, rendered as markdown
  in the Files view.
- **View the roadmap** — `GET /api/roadmap` parses `roadmap/roadmap.md` (written by
  `plan-pm --roadmap`) into ordered phases, each cross-referenced against the live PRD set so
  a card shows the same completion pill the Board uses. The same payload is also folded into
  `/api/data` under `roadmap`, so both live and static modes render the tab. The Roadmap view
  is **read-only for v1** (no write endpoints — the roadmap is authored by `plan-pm`). The
  server accepts `--view <board|roadmap>` to choose the initial tab; `plan-pm --roadmap`
  launches with `--view roadmap`. The **Roadmap** nav tab appears only when a roadmap exists
  (or in interactive mode); each phase renders as a lane (reusing the Kanban column, header,
  and card/pill components) with `Phase 0 — Shipped` first and the tune log in a footer accordion.

### Security posture (unchanged spirit, wider surface)

- Binds **127.0.0.1 only** (criterion 6); the `Host` header must be local.
- Every `/api/*` call requires the per-run `X-Msg-Token` header. The token is generated at
  server start and injected only into the served HTML — cross-origin pages can't read it,
  and the custom header forces a CORS preflight the server never grants.
- All paths are resolved and confined to `--root`; reads are extension-allowlisted
  (`.md .json .txt .yaml .yml .toml`, ≤2 MB) and skip `.git`/`node_modules`/`.env*`;
  **writes are restricted to PRD markdown in any lifecycle lane
  (`features/{planned,wip,done}/prd-*/`, or the legacy flat `features/prd-*/`) plus
  the single root `INTAKE.md` status-cell carve-out (H5)** — the server cannot write anywhere else,
  writes no other INTAKE.md cell, and never writes the issues file
  `report-prd-<N>-<K>.json` (the finding→ticket projection stays read-time;
  `followUp.status` is written solely by `eng --build`).

## Step 2 — Data model (what the server parses)

Same read model as before — now implemented in `server.py`, re-run per request:

1. **Frontmatter** per `features/[<lane>/]prd-*/prd-*.md` — PRD dirs are enumerated
   lane-agnostically (each of `planned/wip/done/` then the legacy flat path, deduped
   by PRD id so one PRD is listed once) (missing fields are normal → `null`;
   missing/unparseable frontmatter → `skipped[]`, keep going).
2. **F-ID feature rows** from `## N. Features…` (any leading number, e.g.
   `## 6. Features & acceptance criteria`), falling back to `## Execution Table` (legacy)
   or `## N. Feature execution table` (new).
3. **Todos** under `## Todos` / `## N. Todos` (e.g. `## 11. Todos`) → tickets per
   `.claude/skills/eng/refs/plan/template-todo.md` (`**<id> — <title>**` + labelled field
   bullets). A ticket's `done` is read from its `- **done:** true` field when present
   (written by the toggle endpoint); absent → `false`.
4. **Gate issues** from the per-run **issues file** — the failed-run `.json` colocated in
   the PRD's `reports/` folder, sharing a stem with the human report
   (`report-prd-<N>-<K>.json`) — globbed lane-agnostically from
   `features/[<lane>/]prd-*/reports/report-prd-*-*.json` and its one-level sub-PRD nest
   `features/[<lane>/]prd-*/prd-*/reports/report-prd-*-*.json` (`<lane>` ∈ the three
   lanes or absent for the flat path), plus `features/reports/report-*.json`
   (the no-PRD fallback), via the shared **finding → issue-ticket projection** in
   `eng/refs/build/report-fix.md` (read-time view, never re-serialized). No issues file →
   `gateIssues: []`.
5. **Run reports** from `features/[<lane>/]prd-*/reports/report-prd-*-*.md` (one level of
   nested `prd-*` sub-dirs included, resolved across the three lanes and the flat path)
   and `features/reports/report-*.md` (the no-PRD fallback),
   per `.claude/skills/shared/refs/report-schema.md` — frontmatter → typed fields, body
   → raw markdown `detail`, containing `prd-*` folder → `prdId`. The
   `report-prd-<N>-<K>-fix-plan.md` fix plans are **excluded** — they are not reports.
   Missing/unparseable frontmatter → `skipped[]`. No reports → `reports: []`.
6. **Intake ledger** from root `INTAKE.md` (H2) via `build_intake`: the ledger table is
   located by its header row (must carry `#` / `idea` / `status` columns), then each data
   row is parsed into `{num, date, type, idea, goal, grade, gradeRaw, status, prd, prdKnown,
   prdPath, prdFeature}`. The `grade` cell (`C:5 T:8 S:next`) is split into
   `{complexity, token, sequence}` for the three chips. A row's `prd` cell is cross-referenced
   against the live PRD set so a card links to its mapped PRD. Absent `INTAKE.md` →
   `intake: {exists: false, rows: []}`; a present-but-empty table → `rows: []`.
7. **Completion inference (H1 ladder)**, most-authoritative first:

   | Signal | Bucket |
   |---|---|
   | frontmatter `completion:` override (written by the GUI) | that bucket, verbatim |
   | PR `staging → main` MERGED (references this PRD) | `shipped` (production) |
   | `staging-signoff:` stamp present in the frontmatter | `staged` (human-approved) |
   | PR `feature → staging` MERGED | `staged` |
   | PR `feature → staging` OPEN | `gated` (pre-merge passed) |
   | `feat/prd-<n>-*` branch exists | `building` (in build) |
   | frontmatter `status: eng`/`engineering` | `planned` |
   | anything else | `product` |

   The PR-state rungs come from `gh pr list --json` and need `gh` + a git remote; the
   `staging-signoff:` rung is read straight from frontmatter. When `gh`/a remote is
   unavailable (or slow), the PR rungs are skipped and the ladder falls through **silently
   down-ladder** to the stamp/branch/frontmatter rungs — never an error. Record the winning
   rung as a human string in `completionSource`. Board columns render the six v2 buckets
   `product · planned · building · gated · staged · shipped`; a card can now visibly sit in
   `gated`, `staged`, or `shipped`.

## Step 3 — Data contract

The JSON shape `index.html` expects (inline in static mode, from `/api/data` in live mode)
is unchanged from the previous protocol revision, with these notes:

- A top-level `project` string names the board (the `<h1>` title and the browser tab).
  The server resolves it via a ladder — `devkit/ARCHITECTURE.md` H1 (its interpolated
  `# <name> — Architecture`, suffix stripped) → `README.md` H1 → `CLAUDE.md` H1 → repo
  folder name → `"Your Project"`. Static producers should embed the same string; if
  absent the GUI falls back to `"PRD Board"`.
- `detail` is still the **raw PRD markdown body** as a plain string. The GUI renders it
  client-side through its own self-contained, injection-safe formatter (source is
  HTML-escaped before any markup transformation; no external libraries, no network) and
  now **splits it into one collapsible accordion per `##` section**. Section-name
  matching tolerates an optional leading section number, so both the legacy unnumbered
  headings and the new numbered template render: `## Todos` / `## 11. Todos`,
  `## Execution Table` / `## 7. Feature execution table`, and `## 3. Features` /
  `## 6. Features & acceptance criteria` (any `## N. Features…`). The Todos dump is
  omitted (todos render in their own section). The findings section — new
  `## N. Plan tune findings` (legacy `## Audit — <date>` still supported) — plus any
  nested `### 12. Findings` eng list is parsed into a dedicated **Plan-tune findings**
  table. In the new template that section is itself a **markdown table** with columns
  `# | Date | Auditor | Severity | What is wrong | Suggested fix | Why it matters | Status`
  (Auditor is `P` or `E`; Status is Open / Fixed / Still open / Clean; `Clean`/empty-
  severity rows are skipped). Legacy prose findings (`Finding N — Severity — Title`) are
  still parsed as a fallback. The rendered table shows columns **#, Date, Auditor,
  Severity, What is wrong, Suggested fix, Why it matters, Status** — cells missing from a
  legacy/eng finding (Date/Auditor/Status) render as `—`. Producers must keep passing raw
  markdown — never pre-rendered HTML.
- todos may carry `done: true` (from the toggle field); todo progress fractions are real
  when the field exists and `0/N` otherwise.
- an optional top-level `projectFiles: [{path, group, content}]` may be embedded in
  **static** mode to light up the read-only Files view; live mode ignores it and uses the
  API.
- each PRD carries `lane` — its lifecycle lane (`planned`/`wip`/`done`) or `null` for a PRD
  still at the legacy flat path. A PRD in the `done` lane resolves to `completion: shipped`
  (`completionSource: "PRD in done/ lane (shipped to production)"`) unless a frontmatter
  `completion` override says otherwise.

```

## Step 4 — Static fallback (no server)

When interactive mode isn't possible or wanted:

1. Collect the Step 3 JSON yourself (read-only — same parsing rules as Step 2; never write
   or modify any PRD file). Write it to a fresh temp dir (`mktemp -d`) — never into the
   repo. Optionally include a top-level `projectFiles` (path/group/content) array to light
   up the read-only Files view.
2. Fill the template by running `refs/gui/fill-static.py` — **do not** Read/splice
   `index.html`/`styles.css` by hand. The script does the `__STYLES__` / `__PRD_DATA__` /
   `__API_TOKEN__` substitution (validates the JSON, escapes `</` so the inline data can't
   break out of its `<script>` tag, and leaves the token empty so the editing UI stays off):

   ```bash
   DIR=$(mktemp -d)
   #   …write the Step-3 data contract to "$DIR/data.json"…
   python3 .claude/skills/msg/refs/gui/fill-static.py \
     --data "$DIR/data.json" --out "$DIR/index.html"
   ```

   Defaults resolve the template and CSS from the sibling `refs/gui/` files. Pass
   `--default-view roadmap` to open on the Roadmap tab (omit it to leave the JS `board`
   fallback). `--data -` reads the JSON from stdin instead of a file.
3. Serve the temp dir GET-only: `python3 -m http.server <port> --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory "$DIR"`.
4. Open the browser / print the URL; tear down as in Step 1.

Templates must stay as files under `refs/gui/` — never inline the HTML/CSS in this
protocol (criterion 25). The design system in `styles.css` is hardcoded and identical
across every project (light + dark, responsive); it is **not** sourced from
`devkit/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (criterion 26).

### Error cases
- `python3` missing / ports busy → surface it, don't fail silently (error case 1).
- Malformed PRD frontmatter or an unparseable issues `.json` → `skipped[]`, flagged in the
  board header; the rest still render (error case 2).
- Browser won't open → print the `127.0.0.1` URL (error case 3).
- `claude` CLI missing → Prompts runs fail with a visible error in the run's output; the
  rest of the board is unaffected.

---

## Gate Issues surface + PRD cross-link (rendering)

- **A distinct surface, not a PRD column.** `gateIssues[]` render in their own grouping on
  the board — one card per issues file `report-prd-<N>-<K>.json` (runId, verdict pill,
  summary counts, `followUp.status`).
- **Every ticket is tagged by `kind`.** Issue-tickets get a 🐞 tag, a `severity` pill, and
  `repro`/`evidence.snippet` in the side panel.
- **Per-issue gate-step badge.** Each issue-ticket shows the originating gate step parsed
  from the finding's `source` field (`pre-merge:mechanical` → `mechanical`,
  `pre-merge:bucket:e2e` → `bucket:e2e`); the raw `source` is surfaced as `Gate step` in
  the side panel.
- **Real done-state for issues.** `followUp.status` is written back by `eng --build`; the
  board renders it, never invents it, and never offers a toggle for it. The
  suggested-command deep-link is
  `eng --build report=features/prd-<N>-<slug>/reports/report-prd-<N>-<K>.json`.
- **PRD cross-link.** A `gateIssues[]` entry whose `context.prd` matches an enumerated PRD
  also surfaces its tickets on that PRD's detail page, tagged `kind: "issue"`.

## Intake tab (rendering, H2)

- **Own tab, front-door.** The **Intake** nav tab (`#/intake`) appears whenever `INTAKE.md`
  exists (or in interactive mode). It renders a backlog board over `intake.rows` — one card
  per ledger row.
- **Three lanes = the D14 lifecycle.** Columns `Backlog · In progress · Completed`, reusing
  the Kanban column/card components. A card sits in the lane matching its `status` cell.
- **Grade chips.** Each card shows the rubric cell as three small pills — `C:<band>`,
  `T:<band>`, `S:<band>` — rendered from the parsed `grade` object (never numeric; the bands
  are the whole point). A `type` pill (`feature`/`bug`) and the capture `date` sit alongside.
- **PRD cross-link.** When a row's `prd` cell is set, the card links to that PRD's detail page
  (`#/prd/<id>`); an unresolved mapping is tagged `unmapped`.
- **Status is the only editable cell (H5).** In live mode a card is draggable between lanes,
  and carries per-lane status buttons (an accessible alternative to drag); both `POST
  /api/intake/status {num, status}`. Nothing else on the card is editable — `idea`, `goal`,
  `grade`, and the `prd` mapping are owned by `intake`/`plan-pm`. Static mode renders the
  board read-only (no drag, no buttons).
- **This tab is the status-override surface.** It is the *only* way to move a row backwards
  through the D14 lifecycle — no skill does that. `/intake --update` refuses to edit an
  `in-progress` row (its PRD is the source of truth); dragging that card back to **Backlog**
  here is the sanctioned escape hatch, after which `--update` will edit it. The two surfaces
  are deliberately asymmetric: this tab owns `status`, `--update` owns content
  (`idea`/`goal`/`type`) plus the re-grade, and `/intake --delete` owns removal
  (behind a warning pass and a confirm). This tab never deletes a row.
- **Content edits are not offered here on purpose.** A hand-edited `idea` would leave the
  `grade` cell asserting a judgment of text that no longer exists. `/intake --update`
  re-derives the grade on a material change; this tab cannot, so it does not offer the edit.

## Reports tab (rendering)

- **Own tab, read-only.** `reports[]` render under a dedicated **Reports** nav tab
  (`#/reports`), grouped by `prdId` (unmapped reports group under "No PRD"), one card per
  `report-prd-<N>-<K>.md` (the `-fix-plan.md` variant is excluded — fix plans are not
  reports) with skill, verdict pill, diff/test stat pills, branch, and timestamp.
- **Detail page.** `#/reports/<file>` renders the report's raw markdown `detail` through
  the same injection-safe formatter as PRDs, with a `↗` cross-link to the mapped PRD when
  `prdId` matches an enumerated PRD.
- **Producers, not the GUI, write reports.** `eng --build`, `/pre-merge`, and
  `/post-merge` own `report-prd-<N>-<K>.md` (`.claude/skills/shared/refs/report-schema.md`); the
  board renders them and never writes, renumbers, or toggles them. Post-merge reports join
  the per-PRD grouping by their `skill: post-merge` frontmatter — staging reports carry the
  human test script in `## How to verify`; production reports render release-style, and when
  the body contains the literal token `IRREVERSIBLE` (a no-rollback platform like iOS) the
  Reports tab surfaces a prominent badge on the card and a callout banner on the detail page.

## What this protocol never does
- Never lets the GUI write outside a PRD's own markdown — any lane, `features/{planned,wip,done}/prd-*/`
  (or the legacy flat `features/prd-*/`) — **and the one root `INTAKE.md`
  status-cell carve-out (H5)**: no repo-file writes from the Files view, no writes to the
  issues file `report-prd-<N>-<K>.json` (`followUp.status` belongs to `eng --build`), no
  writes to any INTAKE.md cell other than `status`, no generated output written into the repo.
- Never invents issue done-state, and never fabricates todo done-state — a todo is `done`
  only when its ticket block carries `- **done:** true` (the toggle's own field).
- Never binds to anything but `127.0.0.1`, and never serves without the per-run token
  guard in interactive mode.
- Never pre-renders `detail` to HTML in the data contract — rendering is the GUI's job,
  from raw markdown, through its escaping formatter.
